(SVR Mocap System)

Developer: Alan Zhang

Description:
The user can use this simple software to record motions in VR reality.
This program supports 5 point tracking (HMD + 2 hand controller + 3 trackers).

The output file is .bvh file, and the default output directory is the desktop.
The user can use blender to convert .bvh file into other useable file format.

Please follow the in-program tutorial to record the motion correctly.

PS: I developed this tool because  IKINEMA Orion is still too expensive for me....
